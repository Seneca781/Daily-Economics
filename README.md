Thank you for taking the time to look at my project. 

I've created a live treasury yield curve, a live currency tracker, and a live commodity tracker. The data was mainly pulled from CNBC. 

My motivation behind this was to solve an issue I faced myself. I wanted a visual representation of the live treasury yield curve, yet I found no public website 
displayed a visual graph, only the numbers. I used the live updating data from CNBC to place on a graph on my dashboard to monitor the 2/10 
portion of the curve every day. 

I decided to add a currency tracker to monitor the major movements and relative positions of a currency compared to other major currencies. 

I also added the commodity tracker to better understand the major movements of commodities such as oil, gold, silver, and platinum. 

This pet project was a great way to keep me updated on major movements in macroeconomic and fixed-income subjects for personal and educational use. 

I also added a commentary portion, to document my own world economic views and commentary on important issues. The recent commentary is from the first week after the 2024 election. 

I plan to add future updates such as more in-depth commentary, and a MAG7 tracker, as well graphs displaying my own trading strategies which I think are interesting, such as volume arbitrage, derivative strategies on highly volatile equities, as well as potential carry trades on foreign exchange pairs.
