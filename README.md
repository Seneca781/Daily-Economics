Thank you for taking the time to look at my project. 

I've created a live treasury yield curve, live currency tracker, as well as a live commodity tracker. The data was mainly pulled from CNBC. 

My motivation behind this was to solve an issue I faced myself. I wanted a visual representation of the live treasury yield curve, yet I found no public website 
had a visual graph displayed, only the numbers. I used the live updating data from CNBC to place on a graph on my own dashboard in order to monitor the 2/10 
portion of the curve everyday. 

I decided to add a currency tracker in order to monitor the major movements and relative positions of a currency compared to other major currencies. 

I also added the commodity tracker to better understand the major movements of commodities such as oil, gold, silver, and platinum. 

This pet project was a great way to keep myself up to date on major movements in macroeconomic and fixed income subjects for personal and educational use.
